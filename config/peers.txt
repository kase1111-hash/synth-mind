# Peer Endpoints Configuration
# =============================
#
# This file configures the Social Companionship Layer for peer-to-peer communication
# between synth-mind instances. When idle, your instance can exchange abstract insights
# with configured peers for collaborative learning.
#
# IMPORTANT: No user data is ever shared - only abstract topics and cognitive patterns.
#
# Format:
#   - One URL per line
#   - Each URL should point to the /api/generate endpoint
#   - Comments start with #
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#
# Getting Started:
# ----------------
# 1. Deploy multiple synth-mind instances
# 2. Uncomment and configure the peer URLs below
# 3. Restart the orchestrator to apply changes
#
# Example - Local Development (multiple instances on different ports):
# http://localhost:8081/api/generate
# http://localhost:8082/api/generate
# http://localhost:8083/api/generate
#
# Example - Production Network:
# https://synth-peer-1.mycompany.internal:8443/api/generate
# https://synth-peer-2.mycompany.internal:8443/api/generate
#
# Example - Docker Compose (service names):
# http://synth-peer-1:8080/api/generate
# http://synth-peer-2:8080/api/generate
#
# Security Notes:
# ---------------
# - Use HTTPS in production environments
# - Configure IP firewall rules in personality.yaml
# - Peers should be within trusted network boundaries
# - Rate limiting is applied to peer communications
#
# To enable social companionship, uncomment at least one peer URL below:
#
# http://localhost:8081/api/generate
# http://localhost:8082/api/generate
