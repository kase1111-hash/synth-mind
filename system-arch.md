System Architecture

Agent OS is locally-controlled, constitutionally-governed, family-owned artificial intelligence infrastructure

Synth-Mind is a complete implementation of the Synthetic Mind Stack (SMS) - an NLOS-based agent with six interconnected psychological modules that create emergent continuity, empathy, and growth.

IntentLog is version Control for Human Reasoning What if Git tracked why, not just what?

Value Ledger serves as the dedicated accounting layer, tracking meta-value derived from cognitive processes without storing sensitive content.

Learning Contracts define explicit, enforceable agreements governing what a learning co-worker/assistant is allowed to learn, how it may generalize that learning, how long it may retain it, and under what conditions it may be recalled or revoked.

Memory Vault is the secure, offline‑capable, owner‑sovereign storage subsystem for a learning co‑worker/assistant.

Boundary Daemon is the mandatory hard enforcement layer that defines and maintains trust boundaries for learning co-worker systems. It determines where cognition is allowed to flow and where it must stop.

Finite-Intent-Executor is a modular, blockchain-based system for capturing and executing an individual's predefined intent posthumously

NatLangChain is a prose-first, intent-native blockchain protocol whose sole purpose is to record explicit human intent in natural language and let the system find alignment.

RRA-Module is an extension for NatLangChain designed to resurrect dormant or unmanaged GitHub repositories, converting them into self-sustaining, autonomous agents capable of generating revenue through on-chain negotiations and licensing.

Mediator Node a lightweight, dedicated node that discovers, negotiates, and proposes alignments between explicit intents on the NatLangChain protocol

Common holds the needed common files between them
